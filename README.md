I'm building this beautiful website to test my HTML skills.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
By the end of the project, I aim to master the following:

- How to organize a project directory
- How to use links and images
- How to make good commits

Note: The project is pure HTML for now, but other programming languages (such as CSS and JavaScript) will be used as time goes on.
